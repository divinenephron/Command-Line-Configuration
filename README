Command Line Configuration
==========================

These are the shell scripts and dotfiles that I use to configure my OS X shell. They all live in a `.cl/` directory and have symlinks pointing to the dotfiles (`.cl/dotfiles/*`) from the home directory. The included rakefile automatically creates these symlinks, just copy it to your home directory then run `rake deploy`
